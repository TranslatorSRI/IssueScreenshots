# Issue Screenshots
This repo works in tandem with [IssueRouter](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/IssueRouter) and its sole purpose is to save screen shots from the Translator UI as part of User Feedback. These screenshots are referenced by the issues found here: [Feedback Issues](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Feedback/issues).
